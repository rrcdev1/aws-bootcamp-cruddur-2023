What has been done so far:

I have completed watching all the videos listed above and followed them to create AWS account. I added MFA to root user and created a new admin user from IAM. I installed aws cli with the credentials I got from the user creation phase. Additionally I created cloud watch alarms for billing and setup an AWS budget too to get notification emails when the budget is exceeded. I have added all this in the journal for week 0 github project and shared the link of my conceptual diagram for the crudder architecture as well. This can be found in the week0 journal. I have completed the 2 quizes as well.
